1. Install mozilla deepspeech
```
sudo apt install portaudio19-dev
pip install requirements.txt
```

2. Download a pre-trained text-to-speech model and unpack
```
# this model is 1.8gb
make download_model
```

# Download test audio
```
make download_test_audio
```

3. Use DeepSpeech CLI to transcribe an audio file
```
# Transcribe an audio file
deepspeech --model deepspeech-0.5.1-models/output_graph.pbmm --alphabet deepspeech-0.5.1-models/alphabet.txt --lm deepspeech-0.5.1-models/lm.binary --trie deepspeech-0.5.1-models/trie --audio audio/2830-3980-0043.wav
```

Run Run!
========
The python script will record your voice for 5 seconds and predict what it said with DeepSpeech trained model
```bash
python run.py
```
Okay so I've recorded very simple "English" with my Japanese accent.
I said "Hello! My name is Naoko"
and what was predicted was "a lohelo my man hesin out cae"
Seriously? Wow... makes no sense. Not even close...


WebSpeechAPI
=============
See `webspeech.html`.
You can host this file on web server and start talking.

```
python -m http.server 5000 --bind 127.0.0.1
```
Open: http://127.0.0.1:5000/webspeech.html

And the result of me saing "Hello! My name is Naoko" turned out to be "hello my name is Malcom".
So yeah, much better than DeepSpeech....


Generally, the default speech recognition system
 available on the device will be used for 
 the speech recognition â€” most modern OSes have 
 a speech recognition system for issuing voice 
 commands. 
 Think about Dictation on macOS, Siri on iOS, 
 Cortana on Windows 10, Android Speech, etc.

Note: On Chrome, using Speech Recognition on a web page involves a server-based recognition engine. 
Your audio is sent to a web service for recognition processing, so it won't work offline.
